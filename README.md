Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate dataset for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.

Practical Python Implementation of the ID3 Algorithm
Implementing the ID3 algorithm in Python provides a hands-on understanding of how it works. Below is a step-by-step guide to creating a decision tree using the ID3 algorithm.
Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries
Start by importing the required libraries for data handling and visualization.
Step 2: Define Functions for Entropy and Information Gain
Step 3: Build the ID3 Algorithm
Step 4: Apply the Algorithm to a Dataset
Step 5: Visualize the Decision Tree
For better understanding, visualize the decision tree using libraries like Graphviz.
